# Lottery_contract



A very basic smart contract in which atleast 3 people participate 
and a each of them donate a minimum amount of ether into the contract 
and a manager which oversees everything can run the smart contract which has stored addresses of all participants and one winner is selected randomly from the 
list and the total money in lottery is transferred into his/her account and after that the application resets and the array gets empty for a new transaction again.
